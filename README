BLURB

  Term::ANSIColor provides constants and simple functions for sending ANSI
  text attributes, most notably colors.  It can be used to set the current
  text attributes or to apply a set of attributes to a string and reset
  the current text attributes at the end of that string.

DESCRIPTION

  This module grew out of a thread on comp.lang.perl.misc where several of
  us were throwing around different ways to print colored text from Perl
  scripts and Zenin posted his old library to do that.  I (Russ) disagreed
  with the implementation and offered my own (the color() and colored()
  functions implemented in this package), Zenin convinced me that the
  constants had their place as well, and we started figuring out the best
  ways of implementing both.

  While ANSI color escape codes are fairly simple, it can be hard to
  remember the codes for all of the attributes and the code resulting from
  hard-coding them into your script is definitely difficult to read.  This
  module is designed to fix those problems, as well as provide a
  convenient interface to do a few things for you automatically (like
  resetting attributes after the text you print out so that you don't
  accidentally leave attributes set).

  Despite its name, this module can also handle non-color ANSI text
  attributes (bold, underline, reverse video, and blink).  It uses either
  of two interfaces, one of which uses "constants" for each different
  attribute and the other of which uses two subs which take strings of
  attributes as arguments.

  See the POD documentation for complete details, features, and usage.

  This module is distributed as part of the Perl core distribution as of
  Perl 5.6.0.  You only need to install this module if you want a newer
  version than came with Perl or if you have an old version of Perl.

REQUIREMENTS

  Term::ANSIColor is written in pure Perl and has no module dependencies
  that aren't found in Perl core.  It should work with any version of Perl
  after 5.6, although it hasn't been tested with old versions in some
  time.

  The test suite requires Perl and Test::More (part of Perl since 5.6.2).
  It also makes use of additional Perl modules for some tests.  These
  tests will be skipped automatically if the modules aren't available.  To
  run the full set of default tests, you will need the Perl modules:

      Perl::Critic
      Test::MinimumVersion
      Test::Pod
      Test::Pod::Coverage
      Test::Strict
      Test::Synopsis
      Test::Warn

  and their dependencies.  These modules are all available from CPAN.

  Some parts of the test suite are suppressed by default because those
  tests are normally only useful for the maintainer.  This includes tests
  of POD spelling and Perl coding style.  To enable those tests, set the
  environment variable RRA_MAINTAINER_TESTS to a true value.  For these
  tests, the additional Perl modules:

      Devel::Cover
      Test::Perl::Critic
      Test::Spelling

  and their dependencies as well as a spell-checking program (several are
  supported by Test::Spelling) are required.  These modules are all
  available from CPAN.

INSTALLATION

  WARNING: Installation of this package will replace the Term::ANSIColor
  that came with Perl.  You may want to save a backup copy of the standard
  version first.

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
  type the following commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  You'll probably need to do the last as root.  If instead you wish to
  install the module by hand, simply copy it into a directory named Term
  in your Perl library directory.

THANKS

  To Jon Lennox for looking at early versions of this module, providing
  feedback, and offering suggestions for improvement.

  To Jesse Taylor for writing the first significant script to use this
  module (colorized calsplit), thus offering innumerable opportunities to
  test and debug.

  To Jean Delvare for providing documentation of what the various
  attributes do on various different terminal emulators, and for noting
  that attribute 2 is dark.

  To Edward Avis for the implementation of uncolor.

  To Rani Pinchuk for the idea of ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED and an initial
  implementation.

  To ATricket for the information about what PuTTY, Windows telnet, and
  OpenSSH under Cygwin support.

  To Richard Maus for pointing out DARK was missing from the exported
  constants list and CYAN and WHITE were missing from the documentation.

  To Autrijus Tang for noticing a problem with string comparisons in the
  test suite.

  To Daniel Lindsley for the information about what Mac OS X Terminal
  supports.

  To Joe Smith for the test files that exercise a wide variety of VT100
  escape sequences including the ECMA-48 color control codes.

  To James Bowlin for catching a bug in colored when $EACHLINE is set that
  caused it to not color lines consisting solely of 0.

  To Helge Kreutzmann for pointing out the need for warnings in the
  documentation about background colors that span newlines.

  To Baron Schwartz for pointing out that cyan and white were missing from
  the documentation.

  To Michael R. Wolf for pointing out that Wikipedia and the ECMA standard
  use faint instead of dark as the name of attribute 2.

  To openmethods.com voice solutions for contributing PUSHCOLOR, POPCOLOR,
  and LOCALCOLOR support.

  To Tim Bellinghausen for the AUTOLOAD taint fix for Perl 5.10.

  To Paul Miller for the idea and initial implementation of colorstrip.

  To Jakob Ilves for sixteen-color support and the initial documentation
  of bright color issues.

  To Revilo Reegiles for reporting problems with the colored function and
  non-array references with stringification defined, and providing a test
  case.

  To Kent Fredric for the request for italic and the report of a terminal
  emulator that supports it.

  To Simon Wistow for reporting that Term::ANSIColor was inadvertantly
  clobbering $@ when generating constant subs.

  To Kurt Starsinic for the initial implementation of 256-color support.

  To Magnus Woldrich for Term::ExtendedColor and for research on which
  emulators support 256 colors.

  To Stephen Thirlwall for the initial implementation of custom color
  support.

  To Larry Wall, as always, for Perl.
